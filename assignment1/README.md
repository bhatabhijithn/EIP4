Assignment 1:
### MNIST model execution score - 99.23%

### Convolution
Convolution is a abstract way of representing features of image

### Filters/Kernels
A convolution matrix which when applied on the image can do blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection etc

### Epochs
Number of cycles the model goes for backpropagation to get weights and bias updated in the neural network

### 1x1 Convolution
Maps only input pixel with all it channels to output without looking surrounding without reducing the information

### 3x3 Convolution
Maps 3 * 3 matrix of kernel which is used for getting edges, vertical and horizontal patterns which in turn represents overall for the image.

### Feature Maps
Output of the image/previous input after running through kernel

### Activation Function
The decision functions to let value pass on to subsequent layers and to cater to non-linearity in neural networks

### Receptive Field
It is the last field must be seeing the whole size of image
