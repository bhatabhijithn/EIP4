Assignment 1:


###Convolution
Convolution is a abstract way of representing features of image

###Filters/Kernels
A convolution matrix which when applied on the image can do blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection etc

###Epochs
Number of cycles the model goes for backpropogation to get weights and bais updated in the neural network

###1x1 Convolution
Maps only input pixel with all it channels to output without looking surrpounding without reducing the information

###3x3 Convolution
Maps 3 * 3 matrix of kernel which is used for getting edges, vertical and horizontal patterns which in tern represents overall for the the image.

###Feature Maps
Output of the image/previous input after running through kernel

###Activation Function
The decision functions to let value pass on to subsequent layers and to cater to non linearity in neural networks

###Receptive Field
It is the last field must be seeing the whole size of image
